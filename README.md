In this project we analyze a dataset of credit card transactions made over a two-day period in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 (0.17%) are fraudulent.

Each transaction has 30 features, all of which are numerical. The features V1, V2, ..., V28 are the result of a PCA transformation. To protect confidentiality, background information on these features is not available. The Time feature contains the time elapsed since the first transaction, and the Amount feature contains the transaction amount. The response variable, Class, is 1 in the case of fraud, and 0 otherwise.

##### Our goal in this project is to construct models to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. We'll attempt a supervised learning approach. We'll also create visualizations to help us understand the structure of the data and unearth any interesting patterns.
